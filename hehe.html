  <h1> MWAHHHH YAwRRRRR I LOVE YOUU SOOOOO MUCH ‚ù§Ô∏è</h1>
  <p> My Love,

I hardly know where to start, because when I think of you, my heart runs over with feelings that words cannot possibly contain. Yet today, I must attempt to do it‚ÄîI must say to you, in all the ways I know how, how much I love you, how much I miss you, and how deeply I am grateful for you. Although we're worlds apart, although there are miles between us, know that you are never far away. You reside in my heart, in my thoughts, in every dream I have for the future.

Distance is a curious thing‚Äîit attempts to drive us apart, yet somehow it strengthens my love for you daily. When I wake up, the first thing that crosses my mind is you. When I walk around throughout the day, whatever I am doing, a part of me is always daydreaming about what it would be like if you were standing right next to me‚Äîlaughing, holding my hand, experiencing the little things. And when I'm closing my eyes at night, you're there with me too, the last thing on my mind before sleep, the most beautiful dream I bring to tomorrow.

I love you in a way that doesn't disappear with distance, in a way that doesn't diminish with time. My love for you doesn't stop at where we are or how many days it will take until I can hold you in my arms once again. It is unwavering, unrelenting, unshakeable. It's the type of love that only increases, even when tried by miles. You are not merely my girlfriend‚Äîyou are my sanctuary, my happiness, my support, my everything.

I close my eyes and picture your smile sometimes, and the entire world seems brighter. I picture your voice, warm and gentle, and the silence surrounding me seems lighter. I ponder how you make me laugh, how you know me in a way that others do not, how you love me for all my imperfections‚Äîand I am reminded of how fortunate I am to have you.

Baby, I need you to understand that no matter where we are, in every sense, I am with you. My heartbeat is for you. My soul is with you. Every day of separation is just one day closer to the day we'll be together again, with no goodbyes, no distance, no yearning. That alone is what gets me through.... I LOVE YOU A LOT...YOURE MY EVERYTHING  üå∏</p>
